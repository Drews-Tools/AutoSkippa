# AutoSkippa
A simple Auto Clicker that searches for the "Skip Ad" Buttons and automatically clicks it so you don't have to. Pros: You cannot be flagged for this as it does not interact with websites themselves but just scans your screen for the image.


This is still early in progress as it will only work for a few popular sites and 'may not' work for all ads. ( This uses Image recongition to detect and locate the Skip Ad button. Because of this, the Skip button is partially transparent and the video behind it can cause problems with picking up the image correctly. ) Keep in mind that this was designed for personal use and I decided to release it publicly for free as I learned a lot from this and thought other could too.
